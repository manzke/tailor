#Web Sockets-based Tail-Client @ Tailor

## Starting Tailor
mvn jetty:run

## Accessing Tailor
http://127.0.0.1:8080/tailor

## How-To Use Tailor
1. Passing the Path to the Log File into Input Box
2. Activating the Checkbox if you only want to see New Lines
3. Press "Connect" to start Tailing
4. Press "Pause" to pause the Tailing and Sending of Log Lines
5. Press "Resume" to resumt the Tailing and Sending of Log Lines
6. Press "Disconnect" if you want to stop Tailing 

##Ideas:
- Create Agents, which are passing Log Lines to the Server
- Add "Register Log Files" Function, so you don't have to pass the Path every time
- Save the Path of the Log Files into the Local Storage
- There should be a Log Line Limit at the Web Client-Side
- Clean Functionality for the Log Line Window
